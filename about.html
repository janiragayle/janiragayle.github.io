            <h1>About Janira</h1>
            <br><br>
            <h3>Janira is a 21-year-old fine artist and software developer from New York City. 
              <br><br>She is currently studying Computer Science and Visual Arts at Columbia University, where she merges her technical expertise with her creative practice.
              
              <br><br>Janira's passion for art is deeply rooted in an exploration of cultural boundaries, heritage, and identity. Through her innovative use of oil painting on unconventional surfaces like yarn and canvas, she creates deeply personal works that serve as both a means of healing and a way to process the complexities of generational curses and blessings. Her art becomes a bridge between the past and present, transforming personal storytelling into a powerful medium for connection and self-discovery.

              <br><br>Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, Janira is the child of a Costa Rican father and a Puerto Rican mother. Although both of her parents speak Spanish and maintain strong cultural ties to their home countries, growing up in the United States presented her with a unique challenge—straddling two worlds while never feeling entirely rooted in either. This experience of cultural duality has shaped her artistic practice, compelling her to examine the nuances of identity, belonging, and the inherited histories that influence her sense of self.
              
              <br><br>Growing up in poverty, in NYCHA housing, Janira experienced firsthand the resilience and struggles that come with financial hardship. Her upbringing instilled in her a deep understanding of scarcity, resourcefulness, and the weight of unspoken sacrifices. It wasn’t until she transitioned to Columbia University’s campus that she fully grasped what privilege and gratitude truly meant. The stark contrast between her early environment and the elite academic space forced her to confront issues of access, opportunity, and systemic inequity in a way that reshaped her perspective. This journey—moving between vastly different worlds—further deepened her artistic exploration, as she seeks to not only tell her own story but to give voice to the often-overlooked narratives of those who navigate similar realities.
              
              <br><br>Janira’s journey into coding began with a simple desire—to build fun and creative websites. Over time, this curiosity evolved into an insatiable need to problem-solve, pushing her to explore the intersection of logic and creativity in software development. Whether she’s debugging code or experimenting with new artistic techniques, she thrives on finding innovative solutions and pushing boundaries in both disciplines.
